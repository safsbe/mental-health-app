# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contibuting to the project! Unfortunately, we are not currently accepting external pull requests.

This document explains the internal workflow adopted by the maintainers of this project.

## Contribution workflow

This project uses a pull request-based workflow.

The following branches are protected from direct push of commits:

- `main` (default branch)
  This branch will contain the latest deployable (though not necessarily released) version of the project

- `<y>.x`
  Branches where `<y>` is replaced with a version number (e.g. `1.x`) are branches which carry an deployable (though not necessarily released), older or upcoming major version of the project.

All contributions are done on a fork or a separate branch with the parent being one of the above. The parent branch will be dependent on the major version that you'd wish to submit changes to.
